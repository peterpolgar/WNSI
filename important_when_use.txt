When you use the WNSI software, for the proper working please remember the following imortant thing:
After the modification of the following global parameters, you need to generate a new WSN topology with
a click on the "Locate sensors" button to enable these parameter changes to take effect on the next run:
 - Number of sensors
 - Battery energy (E0)
 - Enhanced nodes (EN) rate (%)
 - Extra energy of ENS (%)

When you want to see simulation datas of each node of a saved run then if there are no sensors in the ROI then click on the "Locate sensors" button
